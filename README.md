# PDF Download Project

This project is a simple web application that enables users to download PDF certificates by entering an individual's name. The project uses HTML and JavaScript to achieve this functionality.

## How It Works

When a user enters a name in the input field and clicks the "Download Certificate" button:
- The JavaScript code checks if the entered name matches a predefined list of names.
- If a match is found, the corresponding PDF certificate is fetched from a remote server using the provided URL.
- The PDF file is then downloaded directly to the user's system.

## Features

- Easy and intuitive interface for downloading specific PDF certificates.
- Dynamic fetching and downloading of PDF files based on user input.
